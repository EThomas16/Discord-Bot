I have several commands that are currently available for use. These are:
!list_commands - Lists all of the available commands, just like this!
!todo - if you want to request a new feature, please use this command! The author will assess the feasibility and add it if appropriate.
!detect_feline, find_cat - Detects cats from the provided URL.
!tesseract - uses google's OCR model to recognise text in a provided image URL.
!spongify - alters the given text to become as such: input text -> InPuT tExT
!request - Plays the provided youtube video URL in the current voice channel the user is in.
!stop - Stops the bot from playing audio.
!queue - Adds a song to the queue.
Credits go to the bot author Fyrngarm#5098, and the creators of the discord.py API.
