I have several commands that are currently available for use. These are:
!list - Lists all of the available commands, just like this!
!detect_feline - Detects cats from the provided URL.
!request - Plays the provided youtube video URL in the current voice channel the user is in.
!stop - Stops the bot from playing audio
!queue - Adds a song to the queue
Credits go to the bot author Fyrngarm#5098, and the creators of the discord.py API.
